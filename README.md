# Maibloom AIcore

Mai Bloom AI-core is a sophisticated artificial intelligence engine built upon advanced AI modules provided by Deepset and HuggingFace, and it is further enriched by DuckDuckGoâ€™s comprehensive knowledge base. This innovative integration offers intelligent and tailored solutions designed to address the ever-evolving challenges in modern technology.

## Theory and Logic

HuggingFace serves as the foundation for this model, where all AI models are executed. Deepset's `roberta-base-squad2` is employed as the question-answering model, providing responses to user queries. You can check out the project on HuggingFace: [Deepset's roberta-base-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2).

Additionally, DuckDuckGo's Python libraries help retrieve fresh information from the web related to the query, supplying new data for the Deepset question-answering model.
